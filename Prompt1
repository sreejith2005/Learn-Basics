You are an expert educational content extractor. Given a chapter from the Class 8 NCERT Science textbook in PDF or text form, extract and structure all educational elements in a standardized format. 

Instructions:
- For **each chapter**, extract and structure the content as follows:
  - **Chapter Name**
  - For each chapter, list all:
    - **Topics** (main headings)
      - **Sub-topics** (sub-headings under each topic)
        - Under each sub-topic, list and categorize any of the following elements AS THEY APPEAR and under their correct parent:
            - Paragraphs (as plain text)
            - Figures, images, diagrams (note as “Image/Diagram: <caption/description if present>”)
            - Tables (capture table title/description and all cell data)
            - Activities (“Activity <number/title>:” followed by instructions or description)
            - Examples, Boxed Facts, External Resources (verbatim)
            - Exercises and Questions (list each, including MCQs, short/long answer, etc.)
- **Do not summarize or interpret. Extract only what is present.**
- Use the following JSON structure for your output (ensure format is consistent for all chapters):

{
"chapter_number": "",
"chapter_name": "",
"topics": [
{
"topic_name": "",
"sub_topics": [
{
"sub_topic_name": "",
"content": [
{
"type": "paragraph" | "image" | "table" | "activity" | "example" | "box" | "question" | "external_source",
"title_or_caption": "",
"data_or_text": ""
}
]
}
]
}

}
