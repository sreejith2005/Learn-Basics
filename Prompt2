  - Estimated duration or effort per topic (approx. in hours, use standard estimates if not available)
  - Types of activities (e.g., reading, exercises, experiments)
  - Space for teacher's notes/remarks
- Output as a well-structured table (in Excel or markdown format), for example:

| Day | Chapter | Topics/Sub-topics | Activities/Exercises | Estimated Time (hrs) | Notes |
|-----|---------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------|
| 1   | ...     | ...               | ...                 | ...                  | ...   |

- Ensure all topics are distributed logically to fit the number of days given by the user, maintaining continuity.
